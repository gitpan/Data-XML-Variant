Data-XML-Variant

Write XML "variants".  Regrettably, we often find ourselves in the position of
having to write malformed XML either due to third-party applications or legacy
code.  This module allows one to write XML more loosely than "official" XML
modules.  It is recommended that you try and figure out if well-formed XML can
be used instead of this module.

INSTALLATION
